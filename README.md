# 🧠 Self-Driving Car Engineer Program

Welcome to my capstone Udacity project repository focused on **Autonomous Vehicles**. This repository contains my learning journey, projects, and enhancements as I complete the [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013).

> 🚗 “An autonomous vehicle is a symphony of perception, planning, and control.”  
> — My guiding principle throughout this journey

## 🎯 Program Goals

This advanced Nanodegree synthesizes skills from machine learning, C++, robotics, and cloud systems to build production-ready self-driving components such as:

- **Computer Vision** (object detection with CNNs & YOLO)
- **Sensor Fusion** (Lidar + Radar + Camera via Kalman Filters)
- **Localization** (scan matching with ICP/NDT using LiDAR)
- **Path Planning** (behavior + motion trajectory generation)
- **Control** (PID & MPC control loops)
- **Safety & Security** (ISO 26262, adversarial robustness)
